    Generate a data cube.

    Creates a cube view from one or more cube stores, optionally performs some cube transformation,

    REQUEST is the cube generation request. It may be provided as a JSON or YAML file
    (file extensions ".json" or ".yaml"). If the REQUEST file argument is omitted, it is expected that
    the Cube generation request is piped as a JSON string.
